# Human-Activity-Recognition
This project is focused on recognizing simple human activities. First we import the HAV Dataset and then use the KNN classification algorithm. For the purpose of personal activity recognition, the HAV dataset contains 8192 entries, each with 561 attributes. We are using train to test ratio of 7:3.
